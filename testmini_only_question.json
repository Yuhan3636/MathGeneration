Using the ratio of diagonals from the blue rhombus (8 yd diagonal corresponds to 6 yd side), the green rhombus has a diagonal of 4 yd. The area of a rhombus is (1/2) × product of diagonals. Since the side length is 6 yd and one diagonal is 4 yd, the other diagonal is found using the Pythagorean theorem: half diagonals form right triangles with sides 3 yd and unknown half diagonal. Calculating the other diagonal and then the area gives 18 yd².",
